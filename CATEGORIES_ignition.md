Best Mobile App: Our web interface is mobile responsive and UI/UX friendly for mobile users, and we used tailwind's breakpoints to ensure this. Voiceflow is also tailored for mobile use, <br />
as using image URLs is super useful for uploading images on mobile devices. 

Most Innovative: We want to continue building our application after the hackathon, by reaching out to hospitals and clinics for support and investments, improving model accuracy and adding more features, <br />
connecting with experts at conferences like Collision and medtech conferences, and possibly joining an incubator program for this startup. 

Best Use of API: We had a full suite of API usage, from Voiceflow calling OpenAI's GPT to fine tune a LLM on RadQL for radiology question answering, the ByteScale API for preprocessing image URLs for inference and eval, <br />
and a custom created API using FastAPI to deploy semantic segmentation and image-to-text models, as well as a Postman suite to test out these models. 

Best UI/UX: Our project has a sleek and simple interface, that is easy for the user to pick up and use! Simply put in your data and it will be processed in lighting time (like Pytorch Lightning :p)

Best AI/ML Hack: We used a lot of ML tools in our app, from WanDB sweeps, to OpenAI's API for GPT fine tuning, to LLaVa and MiniGPT-4 for base models, to ROCO datasets for training, to QLoRa quantized embeddings and checkpoint training.<br />
We also used ML techniques like semantic segmentation and object detection, as well as image to text algorithms like CLiP, doing a lot of research into Generative and descriptive modelling.
