# radiology-assistant

Our team has come together with an exciting vision - to develop an AI-driven radiology assistant. As we began our discussions, we explored several innovative ideas, including wildfire prevention, text-to-movie conversions, and AI ultrasound detection. After a few deliberations, we felt most inclined towards the AI ultrasound detection concept.

## Objective:
The project is intended to serve as an AI-powered radiology assistant that analyzes ultrasound images to provide insights. The primary goal is to "replace" the need for a doctor to interpret ultrasounds, offering a first-line analysis and guiding users to a doctor if there are any serious issues. However, the emphasis is on recognizing and providing insights about the ultrasound images, particularly focusing on the health of the baby and parent.

## Features:

A user-friendly landing page for users to access the system.
Voiceflow interface for user interaction.
Capability to upload ultrasound images.
An AI model that analyzes the uploaded ultrasound images.
A chatbot (LLM) that uses the insights generated by the AI to answer user queries.
Possibility of a mobile app for added convenience.
Potential features discussed include:
Descriptions of ultrasound images.
Baby health insights.
Information about the carrier's health.
Possible recommendations (e.g., whether the host should consider a c-section).

## Roles and Tasks:

Jerry: Focuses on model training, potentially using QLoRa. He will also port the model onto platforms like GCP, help with the fine-tuning of the LLM, and conduct research for the project pitch.
Williams: Tasked with setting up the LLM using voiceflow, defining the workflow, and minting an NFT of the ultrasound. He might also work on developing a mobile app.
Vivian: Will be responsible for creating Flask endpoints, connecting them to Next.js, and setting up a base page for image uploading and interaction with the GPT chatbot.
Skylar: Entrusted with designing a visually appealing landing page and adding various frontend components to enhance the user experience.
The team also discussed the feasibility of expanding the scope to include other radiology images like X-rays or body scans and deliberated on the specific insights the system should offer.

Overall, the project aims to leverage advanced AI and ML technologies to offer a valuable and user-friendly radiology assistant tool that can potentially streamline and enhance the process of interpreting ultrasound images.
